# Totally 90s Music Trivia

## Overview

This is a fun Trivia Game I built to experiment with some CSS and JS animation and sound effects. The player is asked 10 trivia questions relating to 90s music. The app keeps track of which questions were asked and when the game restarts, the order shuffles so the questions are asked in a different order each time, and during the game the same question is not asked twice. I utilized an array of objects to store information relating to each question the game asks.
